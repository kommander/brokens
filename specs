      ✓ allows to extend the current instance
    hook()
      ✓ allows to remove a hook again
      ✓ allows to tap into instance creation
      ✓ throws for non-existing hook name
      ✓ throws for existing hooks
      ✓ throws for non-existing unhook name

  Handling/Assert Extension
    ✓ provides a convenience checker (verb/object)

    ✓ provides a convenience checker (verb / object, assert.cannot, because)
    ✓ provides a convenience checker (verb/object, is.cannot, because)
    ✓ assert is bound correctly to this.is
    ✓ allows to recover from a specific reason (error code, assert.cannot)
    ✓ recovers from a specific reason (error code, assert.cannot, other err object)
    ✓ allows to recover from a specific reason (error code, is.cannot)
    ✓ allows to recover from a specific reason (error code, is.cannot, false cannot)
    ✓ provides a convenience checker (verb/object, is.cannot)

    ✓ recovers from a specific reason (verb/object, because.cannot, false cannot)
    ✓ checks case insensitive

  Handlor Extension
    ✓ provides a convenience method to handle an error (one handler)
    ✓ provides the handlor interface swell
    ✓ handles an error (one handler, reason)
    ✓ handles an error (one handler, reason, multiword)
    ✓ handles an error (one handler, reason, stacked error)
    ✓ provides reason as first, full error instance as second argument
    ✓ handles an error (one handler, reason, obj)
    ✓ handles an error (one handler, obj, obj)
    with interface
      ✓ hands down the reason first, second the error
      ✓ calls in error context
      ✓ convenience methods to handle an error can be stacked
